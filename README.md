# ansible-playbooks
Collection of Ansible playbooks and roles for automating server configuration and management. Includes playbooks for common tasks such as dotfile deployment, webserver setup, and package management, as well as roles for configuring specific services and applications.

## Steps

To deploy the dotfiles and configure the tools using Ansible, follow these steps:
1. Install Ansible on your local machine:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible
```
Replace `apt-get` with the appropriate package manager for your operating system.

Or

use pip in your selected Python environment to install the Ansible package of your choice for the current user:
```
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git
```

3. Update the `inventory.yml` file with the IP addresses and usernames of your remote servers.

4. Run the Ansible playbook to deploy the dotfiles and configure the tools:
```
cd dotfiles/ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini starship-deploy.yml
```

This will install and configure Starship on all remote servers, and deploy your custom configurations from the `dotfiles` repository.

5. Restart your shell or reload the configuration files for the changes to take effect.
